                The following class shows the basics of how to use the MSTest framework,
                including:

                This test makes sure the right kind of exception is thrown
                when trying to create a formula with no tokens.

                    We use the _ (discard) notation because the formula object
                    is not used after that point in the method.  Note: you can also
                    use _ when a method must match an interface but does not use
                    some of the required arguments to that method.

                  <item>
                    string.Empty is often considered best practice (rather than using "") because it
                    is explicit in intent (e.g., perhaps the coder forgot to but something in "").

                    The name of a test method should follow the MS standard:
                    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-best-practices

                    All methods should be documented, but perhaps not to the same extent
                    as this one.  The remarks here are for your educational
                    purposes (i.e., a developer would assume another developer would know these
                    items) and would be superfluous in your code.

                    In 2025, the MSTest framework has been updated to include the ability to
                    check for exceptions using the Assert.ThrowsExactly method (thus on a line
                    by line basis inside of a test).  This replaces the old way of
                    using the [ExpectedException] attribute which also would tell the test
                    that the code should throw an exception, and if it doesn't an error has occurred;
                    i.e., the correct implementation of the constructor should result
                    in this exception being thrown based on the given poorly formed formula.
                    You can remove the commented out code below once you understand the difference.

                  <item>
                    When using the ThrowsExactly method, you must use a lambda expression. A lambda
                    expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous function that can contain expressions
                    and statements.  We will learn more about lambda expressions later in the course.

                  <item>
                    When testing a constructor, and where you don't need the result of the constructor,
                    you can use the discard notation (i.e., an underscore):
                    <example>
                      <code>
                        _ = new Formula( "5+5" );
                      </code>
                    </example>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                    Once you understand all of the above, you can remove the comments.
                  </item>
                </list>

              <para>
                Example of the old way of testing for exceptions.  This style would result in a passed
                test if any code in the method throws an exception. In the case where there is only
                one line, it is not a problem, but if there were multiple lines of code, the ThrowsExactly
                syntax is preferred.

                You may delete this method once you understand the new way of testing for exceptions.

              <para>
                Make sure a simple well formed formula is accepted by the constructor (the constructor
                should not throw an exception).
              </para>
              <remarks>
                This is an example of a test that is not expected to throw an exception.
                In other words, the formula "1+1" has a valid first token (and is otherwise also correct).
